    ABSTRACT = {Deep learning (DL) has been introduced in automatic heart-abnormality classification using ECG signals, while its application in practical medical procedures is limited. A systematic review is performed from perspectives of the ECG database, preprocessing, DL methodology, evaluation paradigm, performance metric, and code availability to identify research trends, challenges, and opportunities for DL-based ECG arrhythmia classification. Specifically, 368 studies meeting the eligibility criteria are included. A total of 223 (61%) studies use MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to design DL models. A total of 138 (38%) studies considered removing noise or artifacts in ECG signals, and 102 (28%) studies performed data augmentation to extend the minority arrhythmia categories. Convolutional neural networks are the dominant models (58.7%, 216) used in the reviewed studies while growing studies have integrated multiple DL structures in recent years. A total of 319 (86.7%) and 38 (10.3%) studies explicitly mention their evaluation paradigms, i.e., intra- and inter-patient paradigms, respectively, where notable performance degradation is observed in the inter-patient paradigm. Compared to the overall accuracy, the average F1 score, sensitivity, and precision are significantly lower in the selected studies. To implement the DL-based ECG classification in real clinical scenarios, leveraging diverse ECG databases, designing advanced denoising and data augmentation techniques, integrating novel DL models, and deeper investigation in the inter-patient paradigm could be future research opportunities.},

    ABSTRACT={Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality globally. Electrocardiography (ECG) still represents the benchmark approach for identifying cardiac irregularities. Automatic detection of abnormalities from the ECG can aid in the early detection, diagnosis, and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Deep Learning (DL) architectures have been successfully employed for arrhythmia detection and classification and offered superior performance to traditional shallow Machine Learning (ML) approaches. This survey categorizes and compares the DL architectures used in ECG arrhythmia detection from 2017–2023 that have exhibited superior performance. Different DL models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Transformers, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are reviewed, and a summary of their effectiveness is provided. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap to expedite the acclimation process for emerging researchers willing to develop efficient algorithms for detecting ECG anomalies using DL models. Our tailored guidelines bridge the knowledge gap allowing newcomers to align smoothly with the prevailing research trends in ECG arrhythmia detection. We shed light on potential areas for future research and refinement in model development and optimization, intending to stimulate advancement in ECG arrhythmia detection and classification.}
